1- Secure Task Management Application: Develop a task management application with authentication and authorization features. Users should be able to create an account, log in securely, and manage their tasks. Each user should only have access to their own tasks and be able to perform actions such as creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to allow for different levels of access, such as administrators who can manage all tasks and regular users who can only manage their own tasks. Focus on implementing secure authentication practices, such as password hashing and session management, to protect user accounts and data.

2- Secure File Sharing Platform: Build a file sharing platform that allows users to securely upload, store, and share files. Implement authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage the files. Users should be able to create an account, log in securely, upload files, organize them into folders, and share specific files or folders with other users. Consider implementing features such as access controls, where file owners can specify who can view or edit their files, and encryption to protect the confidentiality of the files during storage and transmission.
