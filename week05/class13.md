## Web Socket

What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?

- The proof of life on the backend is obtained through the establishment and maintenance of socket connections between the server and the clients. When a client connects to the server using Socket.IO, it emits a connection event to the server. The server acknowledges this event and responds with a connection event of its own, indicating that the client has successfully established a connection. This exchange of connection events serves as proof of life on the backend, confirming that the server is actively receiving and handling client connections.

Socket.IO gives us the io.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?

- To send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket, you can use the io.emit() method along with the broadcast flag. The syntax would be io.emit(event, data, { broadcast: true, except: socketId }), where event represents the name of the event, data contains the payload to be sent, and socketId is the ID of the socket to exclude from the broadcast.


Rooms:
- A room, in the context of Socket.IO, is a logical grouping of connected sockets (clients) on the server. It allows you to organize and manage clients based on their shared characteristics or purpose. By placing sockets in different rooms, you can selectively send events and messages to specific groups of clients rather than broadcasting to all connected clients.

How do you join a room?

- To join a room, a client socket can call the join() method provided by Socket.IO. The client socket emits a join event to the server, specifying the name or identifier of the room to join. The server receives this event and adds the socket to the specified room.

How do you leave a room?

- To leave a room, a client socket can call the leave() method provided by Socket.IO. The client socket emits a leave event to the server, specifying the name or identifier of the room to leave. The server receives this event and removes the socket from the specified room.

Namespaces:

- A Namespace in Socket.IO allows you to create separate communication channels or endpoints on the server. Each namespace operates independently and has its own set of events, rooms, and connected sockets. Namespaces provide a way to organize and partition the communication within a Socket.IO application.

Each namespace potentially has its own what?

- Each namespace potentially has its own set of events, rooms, and connected sockets.

Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces:

- A possible use case for separate namespaces is in a multi-tenant application. Let's say you have a chat application that serves different organizations or communities. By using separate namespaces, you can create a dedicated communication channel for each organization or community. Each namespace can have its own events, rooms, and sockets, ensuring isolation and privacy between different groups of users. This allows users within the same organization or community to communicate and collaborate while keeping their conversations separate from others.
