# Authentication Readings

This readme provides information and resources related to the topic of authentication. It includes explanations, code samples, and additional resources for further learning.

## Securing Passwords

When it comes to securely hashing and storing passwords, there are a few steps to follow:

1. Choose a secure hashing algorithm: One commonly used algorithm is Bcrypt.
2. Generate a unique salt: A salt is a random value added to each password before hashing to increase security.
3. Hash the password with the chosen algorithm and salt: This creates a fixed-length string representation of the password.
4. Store the hashed password and the salt in a secure manner.

Bcrypt is a widely used hashing algorithm that incorporates a salt and multiple rounds of computation to provide a high level of security against brute-force attacks. It helps protect passwords by making them difficult to reverse-engineer even if the hashed password is obtained by an attacker.

## Basic Authentication

Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme used to authenticate requests to web resources. It involves including the username and password in the request headers.

To make a Basic Authentication request, the following properties are necessary in the header:

1. `Authorization`: This property contains the word "Basic" followed by a space and the Base64-encoded string of the username and password.

Username and password in Basic Authentication are encoded using Base64 encoding. It's important to note that Basic Authentication does not provide strong security on its own and should be used in conjunction with other security measures.

For more details and best practices regarding authentication, the [OWASP authentication cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html) is a valuable resource to review.

## Authentication Process

When it comes to explaining the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter, the following steps can be highlighted:

1. The user provides their credentials (username and password) through a login form.
2. The server receives the credentials and verifies them against the stored credentials.
3. If the credentials are valid, the server generates a session token or issues a JWT (JSON Web Token) to the client.
4. The client includes the session token or JWT in subsequent requests to authenticate itself.
5. The server validates the session token or JWT to ensure the client's identity and permissions.
6. If the token is valid, the server processes the request and returns the appropriate response.

Error messaging in authentication should be designed to provide minimal information to prevent potential attackers from gaining insights into the system's vulnerabilities. Both HTTP and HTML error messages should be generic and avoid revealing specific details about authentication failures.

## Learning Goals

After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals include:

1. Gaining a solid understanding of different authentication mechanisms and their strengths and weaknesses.
2. Learning how to implement secure password storage and hashing techniques.
3. Understanding the role of authentication in web application security and common vulnerabilities to watch out for.
4. Exploring best practices for error messaging and handling in the context of authentication.
