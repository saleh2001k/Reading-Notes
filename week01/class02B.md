### Fundamental data structures
 known as linked lists are made up of nodes connected by references. Each node has information and a link to the node after it. Nodes in doubly linked lists have references to the previous and next nodes, whereas nodes in singly linked lists only have a single reference. Circular linked lists build a circle by joining the final and initial nodes.

Linked lists have benefits including memory economy, efficient insertion and deletion, and dynamic size. Unlike arrays, linked lists may dynamically expand or contract and manage memory utilization.

Insertion, deletion, searching, traversal, and length calculation are among the frequently performed actions on linked lists. Insertion entails putting nodes in any place, including the start, finish, or middle. While searching locates certain nodes based on data, deletion eliminates nodes. The length of the linked list specifies the number of nodes, and traversal allows iterating across the list.

Having a thorough understanding of linked lists paves the way for effective data management and manipulation. It will get easier to construct and use linked lists in many programming contexts wit
