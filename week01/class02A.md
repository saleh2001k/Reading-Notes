## Readings

### Review: ES6 Classes

1. Classes are a template for creating objects.

2. Can a class declaration be hoisted?
   - No, a class declaration is not hoisted. It must be declared before it can be used.

3. How would you describe a constructor and contextual "this" to a non-technical friend?
   - A constructor is a special method within a class that is used to initialize objects created from the class. "this" refers to the current instance of the class and is used to access its properties and methods.

### Using Express Routing

1. Within Express, what does routing refer to?

2. What is the difference between a route path and a route method?
   - A route path defines the URL pattern for a specific route, while a route method specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) used to access that route.

3. When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?
   - It is appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler when you want to pass control to the next middleware function in the chain. If next is passed to your middleware as a parameter, you must call it at the end of your middleware to proceed to the next function.

### Express Routing

1. What is an Express Router?
   - An Express Router is a middleware that allows you to group route handlers together and define routes for a specific portion of your application.

2. By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?
   - We initialize express.Router() by assigning it to a variable, usually named router, like this: `const router = express.Router();`.

3. What do we use route middleware for?
   - Route middleware is used to perform additional operations on specific routes. It can be used for tasks such as authentication, input validation, logging, etc.

### Reflection

- What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
  - After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals are to gain a solid understanding of Express routing and how to create REST APIs using Express. I also want to learn how to implement middleware and handle different route paths and methods effectively.
