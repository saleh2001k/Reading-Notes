#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

One of the important factors to consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem is the efficiency and performance characteristics of the data structure. You should consider factors such as the time complexity of operations (e.g., insertion, deletion, searching), space complexity, and any specific requirements or constraints of the problem.

### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
To ensure that we avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we can follow these approaches:

Define a base case: Every recursive function should have a base case that defines the condition for termination. The base case should be carefully designed to ensure that the recursive calls eventually reach a stopping point.

By carefully designing the base case, breaking down the problem effectively, defining proper termination conditions, and managing memory efficiently, we can ensure that recursive functions don't lead to infinite recursive call stacks.
